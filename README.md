# gh-blog
Minimalistic blog over GitHub's Issues

I got this idea to use Github's Issues for personal notes and blog from https://github.com/rainyear/lolita.
So I changed my blog to use Github's Issue API and host through gh-pages.
At the end of the day I can host my blog for free and conviniently using git and markdown.

The style for the blog belongs to https://github.com/Skepton/Pixelpusher
